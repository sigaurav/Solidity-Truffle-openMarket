# Solidity-Truffle-openMarket
This is a small project for a basic market place to Sell stuff over Truffle Blockchain Network. Deployed on a Truffle Environment and used React to interact with contracts from UI.

# Commands to deploy project
Docs to download and setup Truffle can be found here: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/
## truffle develop
An interactive console that also spawns a development blockchain.
 - Reasons to use Truffle Develop:
  - You are testing your project with no intention of immediately deploying
  - You don't need to work with specific accounts (and you're fine with using default development accounts)
  - You don't want to install and manage a separate blockchain client

## truffle migrate
To deploy contracts on Truffle Environment. Unless specified, this will run from the last completed migration.



# Next Steps:
 - Update logic to capture buyer's address when he is paying for the object.
